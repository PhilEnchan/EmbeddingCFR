## Status

This repository is currently empty and serves as the official placeholder for the paper's open-source code. 

We will gradually upload the complete source code, including core implementations of the EmbeddingCFR algorithm, pre-trained embedding network (HandEbdNet), experiment scripts, and game environment configurations, after the AAAI-26 conference publication.

Stay tuned for updates!
